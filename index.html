				<p>			
					During January and February, there is almost always snow in northern and eastern Finland. Even if there’s little snow in Helsinki, there’s often up to a metre or more in the northern region of Lapland.
					The winter season is definitely the best session for experiencing dog-sledding in Lapland with Siberian Huskies.
					The Siberian Husky is recognised by its thick double coat and triangular ears. Echoing the outline of a wolf, the dogs are energetic and hardy, having originated from the harsh Eastern Siberian wilderness.
